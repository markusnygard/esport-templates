# esport-templates
Set of CasparCG-templates for eSports, based on https://github.com/hreinnbeck/caspar-templates

These are made for Finnish LAN event Insomnia http://www.insomnia.fi/ , but at the moment this is more proof of concept than ready to use-set.  

Feel free to use code as you need, graphic design is something you should made yourself. 

How to install and use:

Copy these files to subfolder of your templates-folder. These can be used like flash templates, data from client as xml (not json)


testFrame.html can be used for offline testing layouts with browser. Do not use internet-server, there are no checks for input data at the moment.
